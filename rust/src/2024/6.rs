//! This problem is quite simple, however due to the constraints of const it is
//! also quite a pain. All state must be kept in the input itself (hence `&mut
//! [u8]`), which is accomplished through some fancy bit twiddling:
//!
//! - all non-newline bytes are masked with [`MASK`]. we assume that the input
//!   is valid, and thus only contains `.` or `#` (or `^`, but this is
//!   overwritten as a [`TILE`] that has been visited going north during map
//!   construction)
//! - as the tiles are traversed, they are marked with the direction they were
//!   visited in. The top 4 bits of each tile are reserved for direction
//!   marking, as all 4 directions need to be potentially marked.
//! - for part 1, all visited tiles are counted for the solution. for part 2,
//!   the solution to part 1 is run, and then all visited tiles are marked as a
//!   [`POSSIBLE_OBSTACLE_LOCATION`]. this reduces the amount of tiles that need
//!   to be checked by about 3.3x (there are 16040 empty tiles in my input, and
//!   4778 are visited during the part 1 solution)
//!
//! A faster solution would be to solve part 1, and then backtrace through the
//! solution, placing an obstacle at the end of the path at each step backwards,
//! and then continuing stepping forwards with the obstacle there. Upon either
//! exiting the map (no loop found) or encountering a loop, step backwards to
//! the obstacle, then step back one more on the original path, and repeat until
//! having stepped back through the entire traversed path.
