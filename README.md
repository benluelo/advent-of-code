My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

# Rust

I mainly use rust for my solutions. For an extra added challenge and to keep things interesting, I attempt to solve all of the problems fully at compile time (or, at the very least, fully within `const fn`s even if compile time takes too long).

# Haskell

I have attempted a few days from 2022 in haskell in an attempt to learn the language. I prefer rust.
